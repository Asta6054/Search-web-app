          An aneurysm occurs when an artery's wall weakens and causes an abnormally large bulge.
          This bulge can rupture and cause internal bleeding. Although an aneurysm can occur in any part of
          your body, they are most common in the:

              <h3>What Causes an Aneurysm?</h3>
              <p class="lead">
                Although the exact cause of an aneurysm is unclear, certain factors contribute to the condition.
                For example, damaged tissue in the arteries can play a role. The arteries can be harmed by blockages,
                such as fatty deposits. These deposits can trigger the heart to pump harder than necessary to push blood
                past the fatty buildup. This stress can damage the arteries because of the increased pressure.

              <h3>Atherosclerotic Disease</h3>
              <p class="lead">
                Atherosclerotic disease can also lead to an aneurysm. People with atherosclerotic disease have a form of plaque buildup in their arteries. This buildup is due to a hard substance called plaque that damages the arteries and prevents blood from flowing freely.

              <h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>
              <p class="lead">
                High blood pressure may also cause an aneurysm. The force of your blood as it travels through your blood vessels is measured by how much pressure it places on your artery walls. If the pressure increases above a normal rate, it may enlarge or weaken the blood vessels.

                Blood pressure for an adult is considered normal at or below 120/80 mm Hg, or millimeters of mercury. A significantly higher blood pressure can increase the risk for heart, blood vessel, and circulation problems. Higher than normal blood pressure does not necessarily put you at risk for an aneurysm.

              An aneurysm may occur anywhere in your body, but the most common locations of aneurysms are:
            </p>
            <div class="lead">
              <h3>Aorta</h3>
              <p class="lead">The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It begins at the left
                ventricle of the heart and travels down the abdomen where it splits off into both legs.
                The aorta is a common site for arterial aneurysms.
                Aneurysms in the chest cavity are called thoracic aortic aneurysms.
                Abdominal aortic aneurysms are the most common type. In rare cases,
                both the chest and abdomen can be affected by arterial damage.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="lead">
              <h3>Brain</h3>
              <p class="lead">Aneurysms in the brain can be any size. These often form in the blood vessels that
                lie deep within the brain. They also may not present any symptoms or signs.
                You may not even know you have an aneurysm. Aneurysms of this type may cause bleeding
                in as many as 3 percent of people.

                You can also have an aneurysm in the artery behind your knee, in your spleen,
                or in your intestines.
